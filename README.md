# Event-Todo-List
Todo task items for events that can be imported into Trello (only tested).
Below is a list of tasks related to the article “Organize a tech event in 2018”. Each todo task is related to the article talk points but there is not a one to one connection. They are set up as reminders so for further detail you can reference the article. You can add or change tasks at will. You only use the tasks that apply to your event. This both helps you to mentally have an overview of what you need to remember and also the current situation of how things are progressing.

Suggested use:
- Create a Trello board for your event.
- Create four columns: Tasks, Next, Doing, Done.
- Copy the list and paste it into the first cards in the “Tasks” column. 
  - When you press the “Add” button (or Enter) make sure Trello creates a card for each task (line separated by Enter).
  - To simplify the Tasks column, you can delete tasks you will not need from it.
- Drag tasks into the Next column when they are needed.
  - Try not to overcrowd the Next column. 6-10 tasks at most preferably.
  - If you are working with a team you can add members to your Trello board and then drag their icons onto the tasks.
  - Add a due date to tasks when needed.
- Those responsible for each task, drag them into doing when they start working on it.
  - NB! Some task may be dragged directly into the “Done” column. 
    - This applies to tasks that are finished like: 
	      “VENUE Available amenities - Venue” and related tasks.
    - They are there as a reminder of how things are progressing.
- When the task is completed do not forget to drag it into done so you have clear view of the situation at each time.

That’s it!
